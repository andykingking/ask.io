			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

			<br /><br />
			<h2>What is this all about?</h2>
			<p>You can read what this is about on the <a href="/about.html">About page</a>.</p>

			<h2>How often will a new favor be put on the front page?</h2>
			<p>The favor on the front page is updated every week on Monday.</p>

			<h2>How do I ask the world for a favor?</h2>
			<p>You can <a href="/submit.html">submit one here</a>.</p>

			<h2>Can I subscribe to updates via email?</h2>
			<p>Yes, you can <a href="/subscribe.html">subscribe here</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>Is there an RSS or atom feed?</h2>
			<p>Yes - it is located <a href="/feed.xml">here</a></p>
			
			<h2>How are feature favors selected? What principles inform the selection process?</h2>
			<p>We are still figuring out the best process for this.  Currently we have a small
			panel of judges who review each submitted favor.  We look for favors that we think would be the most
			meaningful, and which would be best suited for people helping out from all over the world.  
			Usually specific and personal favor requests seems to be best for this.</p>
			
			<h2>How much vetting goes into checking that the favor request is authentic?</h2>
			<p>We haven't really found the need to do much vetting.  Whether or not you want to help out and do a
			favor for someone else is up to you, but we've found that caring enough to do a favor for another is incredibly gratifying in itself, regardless
			of the results of your actions.</p>
			
			<h2>How do I see past favors?</h2>
			<p>We try to follow up with each favor in <a href="http://blog.ask.io">the blog</a></p>
			
			<h2>How did you get such a great domain name?</h2>
			<p>It was simple - I just waited until it expired and then bought it!</p>
			
			<h2>How secure is the data you are collecting?</h2>
			<p>The only data we collect are favors that are submitted, and they are stored securely in <a href="http://firebase.com">firebase</a>. 
			If you subscribe for updates, we collect your email address, which is stored in <a href="http://mailchimp.com">mailchimp</a>.  We will
			never sell your email address.</p>
			
			<h2>How can I help?</h2>
			<p>Doing the favor on the front page every week, and spreading the word about ask.io is a big help.  Also, if you are interested in helping out 
			with the code, you can <a href="https://github.com/humbly">fork it on github</a>.  Thank you!</p>
			
			<h2>How can I contact you?</h2>
			<p>You can <a href="mailto:mike@humb.ly">email me here</a>.</p>
